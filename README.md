Many of us have experienced arriving late to tests, tutorials, or classes simply because we could not locate the correct room in time. 
Building layouts are often complex, signage is inconsistent, and existing navigation tools usually stop at the building entrance rather than helping users navigate inside.
This repeated frustration highlighted a clear gap: while outdoor campus navigation is well supported, reliable indoor, room-level navigation is largely missing. 
To address this, we developed a web-based solution focused on intra-campus navigation within buildings. 
The goal of the website is to help users quickly and accurately find rooms inside campus buildings, reducing confusion, stress, and lost time.
